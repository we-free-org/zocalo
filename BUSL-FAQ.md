# Business Source License FAQ

## What is the Business Source License (BUSL)?

The Business Source License is a "source-available" license that allows you to view, modify, and use our software for free in most cases, but restricts commercial production use without a license.

## Who can use Zocalo for free?

✅ **You can use Zocalo for free if you are:**
- An individual using it for personal projects
- A student or researcher using it for educational purposes
- A developer experimenting, testing, or learning
- A non-profit organization
- A company using it for internal development, testing, or staging environments
- Anyone contributing to open source projects

## What requires a commercial license?

❌ **You need a commercial license if you:**
- Deploy Zocalo in a production environment for your business
- Offer Zocalo as a service to customers (SaaS)
- Use Zocalo to generate revenue or support revenue-generating activities
- Deploy it for more than 3 production users in a commercial context
- Integrate Zocalo into a commercial product you sell

### Examples to clarify:

**✅ FREE USE:**
- Using Zocalo for your personal blog or hobby project
- A startup testing Zocalo internally before launch
- A university using it for research or student projects
- A developer contributing improvements back to the project
- Running it locally for development purposes

**❌ REQUIRES LICENSE:**
- A company using Zocalo for their team collaboration in production
- Hosting Zocalo for your clients as part of your consulting business
- A SaaS company offering Zocalo-based services
- An enterprise deploying it for their workforce

## What happens after the Change Date?

On **[INSERT CHANGE DATE - typically 4 years from first release]**, this software automatically becomes open source under the Apache 2.0 License. After that date, anyone can use it freely for any purpose, including commercial production use.

## Can I fork and modify the code?

**Yes!** You can:
- Fork the repository
- Modify the code for your needs
- Create your own version
- Submit improvements back to the original project

**But remember:** Your fork is still subject to the same BUSL restrictions. If you want to use your modified version commercially in production, you'll still need a commercial license.

## How do I get a commercial license?

1. **Contact us** at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]
2. **Tell us about your use case** - we offer flexible licensing
3. **Get a quote** - pricing varies based on usage and organization size
4. **Sign the agreement** and start using Zocalo commercially

We're startup-friendly and offer reasonable rates for early-stage companies.

## Can I contribute to the project?

**Absolutely!** We welcome contributions:
- Bug fixes and improvements
- New features
- Documentation updates
- Testing and feedback

**Important:** By contributing, you agree that:
- We maintain control over the project direction
- Your contributions will be under the same BUSL license
- We may include your contributions in commercial versions

## What about dependencies and third-party code?

All our dependencies remain under their original licenses (mostly MIT/Apache 2.0). The BUSL only applies to our original code. You're free to use the underlying technologies (Next.js, Supabase, etc.) under their respective licenses.

## I'm still confused about my use case

**When in doubt, ask!** We're happy to clarify whether your specific use case requires a license. Email us at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL] with:
- Brief description of your project
- How many users you expect
- Whether it's commercial or personal use
- Your timeline

We typically respond within 24 hours and err on the side of being permissive for legitimate use cases.

## Why did you choose BUSL instead of pure open source?

We believe in open source and want the community to benefit from our work. BUSL lets us:
- Keep the code open for learning, experimentation, and contributions
- Fund ongoing development through commercial licenses
- Eventually release everything as true open source
- Build a sustainable business around the project

This approach has worked well for companies like MariaDB, CockroachDB, and many others.
