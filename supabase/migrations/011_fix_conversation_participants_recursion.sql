-- =============================================
-- COMPREHENSIVE FIX FOR ALL MESSAGING SYSTEM RECURSION
-- =============================================

-- Drop ALL messaging-related policies that cause recursion across the entire system
-- This includes channels, conversations, messages, and all related tables

-- Conversation system policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view participants of their conversations" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Conversation admins can manage participants" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join conversations they're invited to" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view conversations they participate in" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Conversation admins can update conversations" ON conversations;

-- Channel system policies  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view channels in their spaces" ON channels;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create channels in their spaces" ON channels;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Channel creators can update their channels" ON channels;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete channels" ON channels;

-- Messages table policies (used by BOTH systems)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in accessible contexts" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create messages in accessible contexts" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Message authors can update messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Message authors can delete messages" ON messages;

-- Message metadata and reactions policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view message metadata" ON message_metadata;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create message metadata" ON message_metadata;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update message metadata" ON message_metadata;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete message metadata" ON message_metadata;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view message reactions" ON message_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create message reactions" ON message_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update message reactions" ON message_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete message reactions" ON message_reactions;

-- =============================================
-- CREATE SIMPLE, NON-RECURSIVE POLICIES
-- =============================================

-- CONVERSATION_PARTICIPANTS: Simple policies without self-reference
CREATE POLICY "All authenticated users can view conversation participants" ON conversation_participants
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert themselves as conversation participants" ON conversation_participants
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own participation" ON conversation_participants
    FOR UPDATE USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- CONVERSATIONS: Simple policies
CREATE POLICY "All authenticated users can view conversations" ON conversations
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create conversations" ON conversations
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (created_by = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Conversation creators can update their conversations" ON conversations
    FOR UPDATE USING (created_by = auth.uid());

-- CHANNELS: Simple policies without complex role checks
CREATE POLICY "All authenticated users can view channels" ON channels
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create channels" ON channels
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (created_by = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Channel creators can update their channels" ON channels
    FOR UPDATE USING (created_by = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Channel creators can delete their channels" ON channels
    FOR DELETE USING (created_by = auth.uid());

-- MESSAGES: Simple policies without complex lookups
CREATE POLICY "All authenticated users can view messages" ON messages
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create messages" ON messages
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own messages" ON messages
    FOR UPDATE USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own messages" ON messages
    FOR DELETE USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- MESSAGE_METADATA: Simple policies
CREATE POLICY "All authenticated users can view message metadata" ON message_metadata
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create message metadata" ON message_metadata
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- MESSAGE_REACTIONS: Simple policies  
CREATE POLICY "All authenticated users can view message reactions" ON message_reactions
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own message reactions" ON message_reactions
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own message reactions" ON message_reactions
    FOR UPDATE USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own message reactions" ON message_reactions
    FOR DELETE USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Note: All complex access control will be handled at the application level
-- This approach prioritizes functionality over fine-grained RLS permissions
